Code to support assignment 3 tasks for unit SLE712

# myscript.sh
myscript.sh is a script to incorporate mismatches with msbar into a sequence and perform a blast search 
The EMBOSS tool msbar is used to mutate the sequence to assess the BLAST performance with the changing mismatch density
A loop has been created to run 100 test for each mismatch count introduced
The change of mismatch count from 275 to 525 presented a gradual drop-off of BLAST performance
